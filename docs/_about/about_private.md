I'll start of with some of my hobbies.
As you may already have guessed, I love to play video games and I am a big fan of Souls like games. Most of my free time I spent with my friends and family. If I need some fresh air I like to go for a ride on my motorcycle. And if it's too cold to catch a ride I pick up my snowboard and go to the next mountain.

Some funfacts about me:
I started coding at 12 and built my own farm bot in a game (I got banned btw). That somehow felt so bad, that I quit coding for a while.
