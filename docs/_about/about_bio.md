Currently I am working as a Cloud Developer at [GROW](https://www.growplatform.com/) in Ludwigsburg.
This drifts a bit apart from what I've originally studied.
I studied computer science at the Duale Hochschule Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in Stuttgart (cooperative with Robert Bosch GmbH) which was mainly focused on the automotive domain.
During my studies I got part of the Formula Student team and took the main responsible for the software lifecycle of our autonomous system as the "DevOps guy".
Pretty soon after that I've dived deeper in the DevOps topics.
I've started to automate everything and built a CI/CD pipeline for our software and as you can imagine, I've also started a job as a DevOps Engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH.
This was the time when I've started to work cloud domain.

We mainly worked on small POCs and MVPs for our customers.
The development was UX driven which mainly involved fast prototyping and a lot of customer feedback.
We've used technologies like node js, docker, Pulumi, and many more.
During that time, I've driven deeper into the cloud domain and fell in love with it.
The last project we've worked on was a cloud native product involving process automation and a lot of data processing. It was so hyped, that everyone wanted to have it. 
Soon we've discussed to open up a startup at our incubator [GROW](https://www.growplatform.com/) and build a service out of it. At this point I went all in and quit my job at Robert Bosch GmbH, as I did not want to miss this opportunity. 
Today I'm part of a awesome team that is developing a new cloud native product. In order to build a modern and scalable product we are using technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, Pulumi, and many more. We follow a UX driven development approach, to ensure that we are building the right product for our customers. Everyone is responsible for all parts of our product, from the backend to the infrastructure and operations.
